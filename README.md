Code and files for HW and Projects from MATH 4803 - Science of Data Science

This repository serves as a collection of all code and projects that I completed for my class in MATH 4803 - Science of data science. The course focused mostly on statistical machine learning, and the homeworks were a collection of both theoretical/mathematical questions related to proofs of formulas for different algorithms and coding questions related to implementation of said of algorithms. The questions are derived from the textbooks _Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applicaitons in R, 2nd ed._ by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibhshirani and _The Elements of Statistical Learning - Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, 2nd ed._ by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.

The mapping of Homework assignment to algorithms breaks down like this:
  * HW 1 - Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors (_hw_1.ipynb_)
  * HW 2 - Poisson Process, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression (_hw2_coding.py_)
  * HW 3 - Regression Splines, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Step Function (_hw3_coding.py_)
  * HW 4 - Trees (for Regression and Classification), Random Forests, Maximal Margin Classifier (_hw4_coding.py_)
  * HW 5 - K-Means Clustering, Gradient Descent, Neural Network, Principal Component Analysis, Spectral Clustering (_hw5_coding.py_)

In addition, my team completed an assigned project where we classified characters via the Chars74k dataset using Principal Component Analyis to decrease the number of components, and then implemented K-Nearest-Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
